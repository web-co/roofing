            <p>We highly recommend AM Roofing. From beginning to end – it was smooth sailing! The roofers themselves were efficient, friendly, and respectful. We were impressed. They kept in touch whenever an issue came up, consulted if something seemed “off”, showed us exactly why it was recommended that we replace the skylight (rotted out) and even helped remove the old blind as they knew I was stressing so badly about it! Once the job was done they cleaned up and it looked as if nothing ever happened!</p>
